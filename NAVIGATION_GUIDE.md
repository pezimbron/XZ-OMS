# Navigation Guide

## Quick Access Features

Your OMS now has multiple ways to access key features quickly:

## 1. Dashboard Quick Access Cards

When you log into the admin panel, you'll see a "Quick Access" section on the dashboard with four large, colorful cards:

- **📅 Calendar View** (Blue) - View all jobs in a visual calendar
- **⚡ Quick Create Job** (Green) - Paste email content and AI auto-populates fields
- **📋 All Jobs** (Purple) - View and manage all jobs
- **➕ Create Job** (Indigo) - Create a new job manually

Simply click any card to navigate to that feature.

## 2. Calendar View Buttons

When viewing the calendar at `/admin/calendar`, you'll find two action buttons in the header:

- **➕ Create Job** - Opens the standard job creation form
- **⚡ Quick Create from Email** - Opens the Quick Create page

This makes it easy to create jobs directly from the calendar view when you spot availability.

## 3. Direct URLs

You can bookmark or navigate directly to:

- **Calendar View**: `http://localhost:3001/admin/calendar`
- **Quick Create**: `http://localhost:3001/admin/quick-create-job`
- **Jobs List**: `http://localhost:3001/admin/collections/jobs`
- **Create Job**: `http://localhost:3001/admin/collections/jobs/create`
